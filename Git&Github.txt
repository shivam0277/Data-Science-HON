Git is a distributed version control system
It helps multiple people work on the same project or documents by tracking and managing changes to the files.

Why VCS?
Backup and restore
Collaboration
Branching and merging 
Tracking Changes

We can use git on cmd or git bash(uses linux commands)
Git was originally developed on Linux by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernel project.
Git itself is a C program, and its commands are essentially arguments passed to that program.

to set username and mail-id
git config --global user.name "anyname"
git config --global user.email "anyemail"

to check username and email currently in use
git config --list 

git does not access to all files in local comp.
git initialisation - git init 

git add filename (to add it to git repository or staging area)
git add * (add everything in current folder to git repo or staging area) 

to commit (A git commit is a command in git that captures a snapshot of the project's currently 
staged changes, creating a permanent record in the repository's history.)
git commit -m "message"

The git status command is used to display the current state of the working directory and the 
staging area. It provides a snapshot of your repository's status without modifying any files or commits. 

git diff- Shows unstaged changes(use git add to move to staging area and the commit)

to check if commit is made - git log 

to check the current branch - git master 

Working Directory: This is where you create, edit, and delete your project files locally. Changes in this area are considered untracked by Git until you decide to manage them.
Staging Area: The git add command is used to move changes from the working directory to the staging area. This area acts as a temporary buffer where you prepare and group specific changes into a snapshot before permanently saving them.
Local Repository: The git commit command takes the staged changes and permanently saves them as a new, historical snapshot (commit) in your local repository. This is your personal copy of the project's history.
Reverting Changes: The git checkout command is used to move back through the history or switch branches, effectively restoring files from the repository to the working directory or staging area.

Shows the changes made to a specific file within a given commit- git show <commitid> <filename> 
get commit id from git log , enter file name at last 
Ex- git show 76d6b387ca696b07afd306e8784704e780a42045:index.html

To navigate between various branches, commits and files within git repo- git checkout
Ex - git checkout 76d6b387ca696b07afd306e8784704e780a42045:index.html
here the commit with that specific commit id and particularly index.html file is restored.

to get back to latest version- git checkout master -- filename/*

if we made any change by mistake and save it 
to undo changes, get the last successful change- git restore . or filename(. means all files)
if we added the changes using git add then - 
git restore --staged<filepath> #to unstage
git restore <file_path> #to discard changes in the working directory


Added changes to staging area(didnt commit) after this added more changes to file- git restore --worktree filename(index.html)

how about if we did commit also wrong files
git reset --soft HEAD^(uncommit and keep the changes)
git reset --hard HEAD^(uncommit and discard the changes)

Logging in Git:
git log (shows all commits their time, commit id's etc)
git log -p -anynumber (last anynumber of commits with diff)
git log --stat  (summary of changes)

git log --pretty=oneline (one line mei dikhayega har commit ki information)
git log --pretty=format:"%h -&an:ar%s" (h is hash number author name how much time ago(relative hours) what changed)
git log -S function_name (can be used to get the log of all commits that touched a specific function)

git log --grep="V2" (used to search commit message, v2 is example here)

git log --since="2024-01-01"
git log --until="2024-01-01"

git log --author="Paul" (Paul is example)

all the commits done until now were on local repo
Now we will se how to work on remote repo (remote repo refers to a version of your project that resides on a 
network server or hosted repo on the internet.)

1)create repo on github
2)two options available create a new repo on the command line or push an existing repo from the command line
(here we do 2nd option right now)

git remote (Lists the shortnames of your configured remotes.)
git remote -v (to see the remote repo link)

till now we have seen how to make changes on local repo and push it to remote now we vice versa 
Example - 
create a new file in github on that remote repo and add some content 
commit the changes from there.
Now on local write git pull(used to fetch and download content from a remote repository)

The git clone command is a core Git utility used to create a local copy, or "clone," of an existing Git repository
For example my team members or testers

to clone
1) copy the https link of that github repo
2) go to terminal
2) Now select a directory 
Ex - ls , mkdir Git(to create folder Git if not present or use any folder) , cd Git/ (entered the Git directory)
3) git clone https-link-of-repo
4) Now if u write ls in Git directory that repo will be present.
