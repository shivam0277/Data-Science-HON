Git is a distributed version control system
It helps multiple people work on the same project or documents by tracking and managing changes to the files.

Why VCS?
Backup and restore
Collaboration
Branching and merging 
Tracking Changes

We can use git on cmd or git bash(uses linux commands)
Git was originally developed on Linux by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernel project.
Git itself is a C program, and its commands are essentially arguments passed to that program.

to set username and mail-id
git config --global user.name "anyname"
git config --global user.email "anyemail"

to check username and email currently in use
git config --list 

git does not access to all files in local comp.
git initialisation - git init 

git add filename (to add it to git repository or staging area)
git add * (add everything in current folder to git repo or staging area) 

to commit (A git commit is a command in git that captures a snapshot of the project's currently 
staged changes, creating a permanent record in the repository's history.)
git commit -m "message"

The git status command is used to display the current state of the working directory and the 
staging area. It provides a snapshot of your repository's status without modifying any files or commits. 

git diff- Shows unstaged changes(use git add to move to staging area and the commit)

to check if commit is made - git log 

to check the current branch - git master 

Working Directory: This is where you create, edit, and delete your project files locally. Changes in this area are considered untracked by Git until you decide to manage them.
Staging Area: The git add command is used to move changes from the working directory to the staging area. This area acts as a temporary buffer where you prepare and group specific changes into a snapshot before permanently saving them.
Local Repository: The git commit command takes the staged changes and permanently saves them as a new, historical snapshot (commit) in your local repository. This is your personal copy of the project's history.
Reverting Changes: The git checkout command is used to move back through the history or switch branches, effectively restoring files from the repository to the working directory or staging area.

Shows the changes made to a specific file within a given commit- git show <commitid> <filename> 
get commit id from git log , enter file name at last 
Ex- git show 76d6b387ca696b07afd306e8784704e780a42045:index.html

To navigate between various branches, commits and files within git repo- git checkout
Ex - git checkout 76d6b387ca696b07afd306e8784704e780a42045:index.html
here the commit with that specific commit id and particularly index.html file is restored.

to get back to latest version- git checkout master -- filename/*

if we made any change by mistake and save it 
to undo changes, get the last successful change- git restore . or filename(. means all files)
if we added the changes using git add then - 
git restore --staged<filepath> #to unstage
git restore <file_path> #to discard changes in the working directory


Added changes to staging area(didnt commit) after this added more changes to file- git restore --worktree filename(index.html)

how about if we did commit also wrong files
git reset --soft HEAD^(uncommit and keep the changes)
git reset --hard HEAD^(uncommit and discard the changes)
